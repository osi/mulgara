          <h1 class="heading1">Mulgara Rules Engine (Krule) Users
          Guide</h1>
          <p class="bodytext">Mulgara includes a custom rules
          engine known as Krule (pronounced "cruel" by its lead
          developer).</p>

          <p class="bodytext">The purpose of Krule is to apply a
          set of entailment rules to a base set of statements
          ("facts"), producing new statements based on those facts.
          In other words, Krule applies a set of pre-defined rules
          to statements in a model. The application of the rules
          results in some new RDF statements, which may be added to
          that model or stored elsewhere.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Krule is implemented in a manner
          consistent with Mulgara. Rule definitions are provided in
          RDF files and may be loaded into Mulgara models.
          Similarly, Krule acts upon statements in models and
          produces statements which may be stored in the same or
          different models. Krule is "triples all the way
          down".</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Krule has been used to entail RDF
          Schema rules and ongoing work may lead to a more scalable
          method of dealing with Web Ontology Language (OWL)
          analysis. Users and developers are encouraged to
          investigate this impressive new addition to Mulgara.
          Anyone may add new rules and apply them to
          models.</p><a name="okrule1" id="okrule1">

          <h2 class="heading3">Setting up Krule</h2>

          <p class="bodytext">Some setup is required before one may
          use Krule. Please note that this tutorial presumes the
          use of &rsquo;localhost&rsquo; as a machine name,
          &rsquo;server1&rsquo; as a database name. If you choose
          to change these or use different model names for the
          Krule setup, you may have to also change the URLs
          embedded in the Krule rules files (called krule.owl and
          rdfs-krule.rdf, both of which are located in the
          .../mulgaa/rules/ directory) and in the commands
          given below.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">First, set up some handy aliases:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
# set up aliases
alias &lt;http://mulgara.org/mulgara#&gt; as mulgara;
alias &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; as rdf;
alias &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; as rdfs;
alias &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; as owl;
alias &lt;http://mulgara.org/owl/krule/#&gt; as krule;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Next, create some special models
          which are used by Krule and presumed to be present:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
# create utility models
create &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#type&gt; &lt;mulgara:TypeModel&gt;;
create &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#prefix&gt; &lt;mulgara:PrefixModel&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Create a model to hold the Krule
          statements. Naturally, the URL that you use may vary:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
# clear and create the rules model
drop &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#krule&gt;;
create &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#krule&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Load the Krule ontology into your
          krule model. This ontology is used regardless of which
          rules are used. You will need to replace "@basedir@" with
          the path to your Mulgara source code
          installation:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
# Load the ontology for how the rules data fits together.
load &lt;file:@basedir@/rules/krule.owl&gt;
     into &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#krule&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Load your rules into your krule
          model. In this case, we are loading the RDF Schema
          entailment rules which are provided in the file
          .../mulgara/rules/rdfs-krule.rdf.</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
# Load the rules data.
load &lt;file:@basedir@/rules/rdfs-krule.rdf&gt;
     into &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#krule&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Krule is now ready to go. All you
          have to do is apply the rules to some RDF statements,
          known in the parlance as "base data". This is covered in
          the next section.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Please note that the instructions in
          this section follow the file
          .../mulgara/rules/example.itql, originally written by
          Paul Gearon.</p><a name="okrule2" id="okrule2">

          <h2 class="heading2">Using Krule</h2>

          <p class="bodytext">Krule is used by applying a set of
          rules to a set of RDF statements. The rules are
          themselves RDF statements and are stored in their own
          model. The RDF statements upon which those rules are
          applied are known as "base data" and are stored in
          another model.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">The application of the rules to the
          base data is accomplished by issuing the "apply" iTQL
          command, like this:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
apply &lt;rulesmodel&gt; to &lt;basemodel&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">A Mulgara instance may have many
          different models containing rules, since the rules are
          just a set of RDF statements.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Using apply that way will place the
          newly-generated entailed statements into the base
          data&rsquo;s model (&lt;basemodel&gt;). If you want to
          put the entailed statements into a separate model, you
          may do so with this syntax:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
apply &lt;rulesmodel&gt; to &lt;basemodel&gt; &lt;entailedmodel&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Base data may consist of any RDF
          statements stored in a Mulgara model. There are no
          restrictions on what kind of data may have Krule rules
          run against it.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">To try Krule, you first need to
          complete the setup steps above. Once that is done, you
          need to find some sample data. Fortunately, Mulgara ships
          with some sample data. You can create a model and load it
          in:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
drop &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#input&gt;;
create &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#input&gt;;
load &lt;jar:file:/@basedir@/dist/mulgara-<em>x.y.z</em>.jar!/data/w3c-news.rss&gt;
     into &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#input&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Although Krule allows you to put the
          entailed statements into the same model as the base data,
          we will separate them so you can see what was created. To
          do that, we need to create a model to hold the
          output:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
drop &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#output&gt;;
create &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#output&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Now we are ready to apply the rules
          to the base data in the input model and store the
          resulting entailed statements in the output model:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
apply &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#krule&gt;
      to &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#input&gt;
			&lt;rmi://localhost/server1#output&gt;;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">The newly-created entailed statements
          may be viewed by querying the output model:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
select $subject $predicate $object
from &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#output&gt;
where $subject $predicate $object;
</p>

          <p class="bodytext">We can show the numbers of statements
          in the input and output models by using iTQL&rsquo;s
          count function:</p>
          <p class="commandtext">
select 
count ( select $subject $predicate $object
        from &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#input&gt;
				where $subject $predicate $object
)
from &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#input&gt;
where $subject $predicate $object;
</p>

          <table border="1">
            <thead>
              <tr>
