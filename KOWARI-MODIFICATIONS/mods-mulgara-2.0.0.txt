Fix close test: if we're fast enough the interrupt from the close()
may not have been processed yet, so we can get hit with it in the
Thread.join().

Merged branch mgr-121-lockrecovery.

This contains three sets of changes:
 1. support for idle and transaction timeouts - this closes #121, #122, and #125.
 2. synchronization fixes and simplifications for the transactions
 3. miscellaneous small fixes to the transactions - this closes #101.

Mistakenly changed SPDecimal to handle floating point, but the bug report leading to this was really about not throwing an exception for floating point values. Now accepting any lexical value for typed literals, and falling back to using untyped data when the semantics are violated, e.g. when a floating point value is giving for an integer, or a string is given for a number.

   D /trunk/src/jar/util-xa/java/org/mulgara/store/xa/ObjectPool.java

Deleted ObjectPool and all references to it.

This is a real architectural change, as the use of these pools was pervasive in the lower layers.

In JDK 1.4, object pools were required for efficient operation, however, improvements in memory
management in JDK 1.5 changed the recommendations from Sun to eliminate object pools partly
to help the garbage collector, and partly because allocation was typically much faster:
  http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/HotSpotFAQ.html#gc_pooling
Since we no longer support JDK 1.4, then this is an overdue change. Apparently JDK 1.6 offers
even better performance.

A number of changes resulted in poor formatting, so this was cleaned up at the same time.
Also, a number of warnings were removed (e.g. non-typed WeakReferences and phase lists
in the FreeList class). This was outside of the scope of removing the object pools, but
the opportunity to make the modification was there, and these classes are unlikely to be
revisited in the foreseeable future.
