LocalQuery and complete the refactorings associated with mgr-69.

Fix file-descriptor leak: close tuples after use. TuplesOperations methods such
as append(), join(), and subtract() make copies of the input tuples, so those
inputs need to be explicitly closed. The missing closes were causing a file
leak (and eventually a too-many-open-files error) in materialized HybridTuples.

not for delete/select (i.e. don't "create" values on delete).

Reviewed ronald's fix to the transaction manager;
Extracted a one line function to document the intent better;
Added two lines of cleanup to the transaction abort cascade to allow for the
implicitRollback control flow to now be truncated by an exception.

Fix error handling in implicit rollback. Since any error here will lead to
abortTransaction() being invoked, clearing the manager in the error case will
lead to a NPE in abortTransaction(). Furthermore, since abortTransaction()
cleans everything up it seems better to leave the error handling to that.

Fix write-lock acquisition bug and created test cases for it. The logic error
was causing a second transaction to steal the write-lock instead of waiting
for it to be released.

I found the original confusing it made the locking bug harder to see.
