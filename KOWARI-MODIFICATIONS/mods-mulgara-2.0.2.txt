Add logging of exceptions that occur while executing commands from a script.  Without this change, any TQL errors are lost because there is no output to System.out in script mode.

Fix resolver xa-resource activation for externally managed transactions.

The Resolver's XAResource's were not being called correctly: end() was never
being invoked, and start() was only invoked once at enlistment time. This
caused problems for resolvers that need to track per-transaction information
because in an RMI environment different operations in the same transaction may
occur in different threads, i.e. the thread-xid association may change during
the course of a transaction.

The XAResource's are now properly suspended after each operation and resumed
before each operation, just like for internally managed transactions. Also,
end() is always invoked before any prepare(), commit(), or rollback().

Changed paths:
   M /trunk/src/jar/content-n3/java/org/mulgara/content/n3/Parser.java

Fix concurrent string-pool-session access bug.

The parser, running in a separate thread, was allocating blank-node ids via
ResolverSession.localize(), thereby creating a situation where two threads
were accessing the same ResolverSession (and therefore the same
StringPoolSession) concurrently. The fix here is to delay the id allocation
and have the main thread do it instead.

Other solutions would have included adding extra synchronization to various
classes (e.g. the ResolverSession and StringPoolSession), but it seemed like
we'd be punishing all other code and paths for this one errant usage.
