<p>
This package defines a set of APIs required to implement an RDF Graph and it's
associated objects. The basis for this package structure comes
from various sources including:
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">the W3C RDF specifications</A>
and existing Java mappings including:
<A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena.htm">Jena</A>,
<A HREF="http://sesame.aidministrator.nl/">Sesame</A> and
<A HREF="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/api.html">Sergey Melnik's RDF API</A>.
</p>
<p>
An RDF Graph is made from RDF triples.  Triples consist of a subject,
predicate and object.  Triples are made of nodes.  Nodes can either be resources
or literals.  Resources can either be labelled with a URI, called URI
references, or be blank.
</p>
<p>
To construct nodes you use a GraphElementFactory which allows you to create any of the
nodes individually.  This allows a separation between the implementation of the
Graphs and of Node storage and handling.
