Resolver SPI.
</abstract>
<p>
This package is a service provider interface for plugin libraries that manage
a particular type of statement store.
A {@link org.mulgara.resolver.spi.ResolverFactory} is provided with resources
via the {@link org.mulgara.resolver.spi.ResolverFactoryInitializer} interface
when it is installed.  Thereafter, the factory produces
{@link org.mulgara.resolver.spi.Resolver}s which may create, modify and delete
models, and which produce {@link org.mulgara.resolver.spi.Resolution}s to
{@link org.mulgara.query.Constraint}s.
