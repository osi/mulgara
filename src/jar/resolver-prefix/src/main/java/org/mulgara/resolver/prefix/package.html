    <h1>Prefix Resolver.</h1>
    <p>This package is an internal resolver for extracting all elements with a specified prefix from RDF.  In particular, this is useful for sequence elements from RDF.  These elements are referred to with predicates of the form <code>rdf:_<i>n</i></code>, where <i>n</i> is the number of the element in the sequence.</p>
    <p>This resolver searches the string pool for all nodes starting with a prefix, and returns the results.  The remainders of <code>rdf:_</code> strings are guaranteed to be numbers, simply because there are no other options defined in the rdf namespace.</p>
