"Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor." 

"Is there any other opening?" 

"None." 

"So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the
house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?" 

"There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end." 

"Had Sir Charles reached this?" 

"No; he lay about fifty yards from it." 

"Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer -- and this is important -- the 

marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass? "

"No marks could show on the grass." 

"Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?" 

"Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the
moor-gate." 

"You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate
closed?" 

"Closed and padlocked." 

"How high was it?" 

"About four feet high." 

"Then anyone could have got over it?" 

"Yes." 

"And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?" 

"None in particular." 

"Good heaven! Did no one examine?" 

"Yes, I examined, myself." 

"And found nothing?" 

"It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for
five or ten minutes." 

"How do you know that?" 

"Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar." 

"Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the
marks?"
